### Hi there ✌

I'm a Brazillian developer that loves technology and education. I have discovered my passion with the development world with 9yo, so I'm coding since 😜

I have a pretty big knowledge of JavaScript and web environments, so I try to share it on the web via courses, videos, and articles.
